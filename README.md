# 🌸 Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

### ✅ Internship Task – CodSoft | Python Programming (4 Weeks)

---

## 📌 Objective

The objective of the task is to develop a machine learning model that will accurately classify iris flowers into three species according to their sepal and petal measurements. These species are Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

---

## 🔗 Dataset

- **Filename:** IRIS.csv (Has been uploaded to the system manually)
- **Features:**
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- **Target:** Iris Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Programming language - Python
- Data handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning models - Scikit-learn

---

## 🧠 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading** - Loaded the uploaded IRIS.csv file.
2. **Exploration** - Analyzing dataset structure, types and distributions.
3. **Visualization** - Pairplots and correlation heatmaps.
4. **Preprocessing** - Cleaned columns and label encoded the species.
5. **Modeling** - Trained 4 classifiers:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Neighbor Classifiers
   - Support Vector Machines
   - Decision Tree
6. **Evaluation** - Compares models in terms of Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
7. **Output** - Saved pairplot image as `iris_output.png`.

## 📈 Results

- All models achieved a high accuracy, especially:
  - SVM and KNN: 96%+
- Setosa separated easily from others
- Model performance verified by metrics and visualizations
